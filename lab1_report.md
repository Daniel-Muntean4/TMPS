## Objectives:
__1. Study and understand the SOLID principles .__

## Some Theory:
The SOLID principles are five essential guidelines that enhance software design, making code more maintainable and scalable. They include Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion. 

## Solid Principles implemented
Single responsability, Open-closed and Interface segregation 

## Main tasks:
__1. Choose an OO programming language and a suitable IDE or Editor (No frameworks/libs/engines allowed).__

__2. Select a domain area for the sample project.__

__3. Define the main involved classes and think about what instantiation mechanisms are needed.__


## Implementation
This program simulates a classroom interaction using OOP principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. By designing flexible components like InputManager, Teacher, and Student, the code allows easy extension, such as adding new teacher types (e.g., FunnyTeacher or StrictTeacher) or modifying student behaviors.

The program emphasizes dependency injection, making it testable and maintainable. It also uses casting (CoolTeacher) and conditional logic to ensure that specialized behavior (like telling jokes) is only executed when appropriate.

To make the simulation more dynamic, you could enhance the InputManager to accept real user input or implement more complex interactions between teachers and students.
